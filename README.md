# Zanzibar
Fall 2022 Final Project

## Instructions
There are 3 six sided dice,
the game is played with 2 or more people,
and each player is given 20 tokens.
The first player rolls the 3 dice to try and get the
highest possible score (They can roll up to 3 times).
Next, players will try to out roll the original players
number using an equal amount or fewer rolls.
Whoever rolls the lowest value gets the number of tokens
designated from the highest role from each person
(if someone rolled a zanzibar (4,5,6), then the loser would
get 4 tokens from every player).
Whoever rolled the highest gets to start the next round
(The same order is kept. Ex: player 3 had the highest roll, out
of 4 players, so the order the next round would be 3, 4, 1, 2).

## Token Ranking
- 4 tokens given if the highest score is 4,5,6 (Zanzibar)
- 3 tokens given if the highest score is three-of-a-kind
- 2 tokens given if the highest score is 1,2,3
- 1 token given to the one with the fewest points <br><br>
  *Whoever gives away all their tokens first wins*

## Dice Roll Rankings
- 4,5,6 (Zanzibar)
- 1,1,1
- 2,2,2
- 3,3,3
- 4,4,4
- 5,5,5
- 6,6,6
- 1,2,3

## Points for single dice
- 1 = 100 points
- 6 = 60 points
- 2 = 2 points
- 3 = 3 points
- 4 = 4 points
- 5 = 5 points

## How to Play
In the main menu, select 'Start Game' to start the game.
When prompted, the game will ask how many people are playing.
Input the integer number of players that are going to play
(anything less than 2 or anything not an integer will cause
the program to ask you the question again).
Once you input the number of players, the game will begin.
When it is your turn, the dice will roll and if you wish
to roll again, type 'y' or 'yes' into the input box.
Otherwise, type 'n' or 'no' if you wish to end your turn.

# Creator's Note
This project was made in my freshman year of college; it was my first time creating a visual
interactive program using Python so, while the project does not look as visually appealing as it could be, I am still very proud of it.
It was also my first time working on a program in a group setting, where each member had their own specific tasks to complete which
came into one whole project.<br><br>
The project required us to:
- Display the rules of the game and a set of instructions on how to use your program
- Display a set of menu options for the various things your players can do
- Make use of conditionals and loops effectively
- Organize code by taking advantage of functions (including docstrings)
- Use file I/O in a meaningful way
- Use turtle graphics to animate something
- Incorporate something to make the project stand out from others
